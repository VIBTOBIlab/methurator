# CHANGELOG

## [v2.1.1](https://github.com/VIBTOBIlab/methurator/tree/v2.1.1) — 2026-01-29

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fixed `gt-estimator` incorrectly assigning the read count of the first sample to all samples in the summary YAML file when multiple BAM files were specified.

## [v2.1.0](https://github.com/VIBTOBIlab/methurator/tree/v2.1.0) — 2026-01-28

### ✨ Minor changes

- Improved the `plot` command for summaries generated by the `gt-estimator` command: the tool now computes the sample's asymptote (i.e., the theoretical maximum number of CpGs) at the extrapolation factor t = 1000.
- The asymptote is now also used to compute saturation values in the `gt-estimator` command.
- The summary file generated by `gt-estimator` now reports the number of reads observed at full sequencing depth (t = 1). This value is also used by the `plot` command to calculate the number of reads for each t.

## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/VIBTOBIlab/methurator/tree/v2.0.0) — 2026-01-24

### 🎉 Major Release: Chao's Estimator

#### ✨ New Features

- **Added `gt-estimator` command** — New primary command for sequencing saturation estimation using Chao's estimator. For more detailed info check the [README](https://github.com/VIBTOBIlab/methurator/blob/main/README.md).

  - Implements a CpG sequencing saturation estimator developed by [Chao Deng et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02804)
  - Built on the [preseqR](https://github.com/smithlabcode/preseqR) framework
  - Extrapolates CpG predictions to higher sequencing depths
  - Distinguishes between interpolated (t ≤ 1) and extrapolated (t > 1) predictions
  - Supports confidence interval computation via bootstrap resampling (`--compute_ci` flag)

- **New output format** — `methurator_summary.yml` with Chao estimator results
  - Includes extrapolation factor (t) values from 0 to t_max
  - Boolean indicating interpolated vs extrapolated data
  - Confidence intervals (if enabled)
  - Model parameters and command options

#### 📋 Notes

- The `downsample` command remains available for backward compatibility
- Existing `methurator_summary.yml` format unchanged for downsample workflow

## [v0.1.8](https://github.com/VIBTOBIlab/methurator/tree/v0.1.8) — 2026-01-03

- Fixed a bug in the plot title naming logic that resulted in all plots having as title the first sample name present in the summary file.
- Fixed some typos in the README.
- Fixed the default number of threads that was not correctly working for HPC environments.

## [v0.1.7](https://github.com/VIBTOBIlab/methurator/tree/v0.1.7) — 2025-12-01

- Made BAM input files positional arguments.
- Slightly updated the sequencing saturation plot.
- Thanks to @ewels for adding a new YAML output file which contains all data in a single file. It also contains run metadata: date, tool version, options etc. for reproducibility and future MultiQC support. An example [here](tests/data/methurator_summary.yml).
- Thanks to @ewels again for some CLI teaks: docstrings for CLI functions, to give intro text; metavars in the help string, to avoid wide column due to --genome options; moved the tool subcommands above --help and --version. Finally, replaced static panel with dynamic Rich progress bar.
- Due to the restructuring above, now `methurator plot` command takes in input the methurator_summary.yml file, to avoid calculating again the sequencing saturation curve.

## [v0.1.6](https://github.com/VIBTOBIlab/methurator/tree/v0.1.6) — 2025-12-01

- Removed `--bamdir` option: if you want to specify more than 1 bam file within a directory you can now simply use the same `--bam` option, specifying all bam files (e.g. --bam files/\*.bam)
- Added Bioconda and Biocontainer instructions on the README.
- Added the --rrbs parameter: if specified (by default), it will add the --keepDups flag to MethylDackel to avoid removal of duplicates.

## [v0.1.5](https://github.com/VIBTOBIlab/methurator/tree/v0.1.5) — 2025-11-23

- Expanded and updated documentation.

## [v0.1.4](https://github.com/VIBTOBIlab/methurator/tree/v0.1.4) — 2025-11-14

- Slightly changed the README and LICENSE files.

## [v0.1.3](https://github.com/VIBTOBIlab/methurator/tree/v0.1.3) — 2025-11-14

### 🎉 Initial Release

**methurator** — a Python package for estimating sequencing saturation in bisulfite sequencing data. Read the [README file](README.md) for more information.
